\section*{Acknowledgments}

David Spivak has been a friend and mentor to me as I write this book and beyond.
In many ways, I see this book as my take on David's research in lens based
systems in recent years. David and I began writing a book together, of which
this book was to be the first half and David's book on polynomial functors (now
co-authored with Nelson Niu) was to be the second. But as we were writing, we
realized that these weren't two halves of the same book, but rather two books
in the same genre. It was a great pleasure writing with David during the summer
of 2020, and I owe him endless thanks for ideas, suggestions, and great
conversation. This book wouldn't exist without him.

Thanks go to Emily Riehl, Sophie Libkind, John Baez, Geoff Cruttwell.
