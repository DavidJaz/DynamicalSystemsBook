* Style guidelines:

  I intend to use this document to leave daily notes and conversations so we have them available to refer to.

Outermost items should merely be a date. Because I started the document and because this is on Portuguese date system for historical reasons, the dates will be in Portuguese, so
 <year-month-day> day-of-week

Underneath the outermost item should be note topics. 

In each note topic, I think we should trade off with headers simply named 
"David" for David I. Spivak and 
"Jaz" for David Jaz Myers. 

(Jaz: Feel free to choose your own name David)

*** DONE Conventions for labelling:
    CLOSED: [2020-07-15 qua 23:40]
    How should we label our equations, theorems, lemmas, propositions, etc
   


**** Jaz: 
     My usual convention is 
       kind:name.of.particular.item

     e.g. 
       thm:polynomial.functors.are.dope

     or 
       eqn:really.complicated.diagram1 
 
       (though, hopefully with better names)

     I suppose it might be useful to also label according to their chapter, like

     C1:eqn:just.a.single.box

     Any ideas?

**** Spiv: 
 My usual convention is 
       kind.name_of_particular_item

*** DONE Drawing a mapsto nicely:

    (This is a real question, but also a nice way to demonstrate how org-mode hyperlinks work :) ) 

**** Jaz:
     I'm having trouble drawing this mapsto nicely: [[file:~/Documents/Books/DynamicalSystemsBook/book/C1-.tex::#problem-drawing-mapsto-nicely][See situation here.]] 
    
     I want this to look nice, as in, to have the mapsto line up under the to, but I've never really known how to get that effect.

     I believe it looks fine how I am doing it now <2020-07-15 qua> 

*** DONE Naming conventions for discrete-time dynamical systems
    CLOSED: [2020-07-15 qua 23:40]
    We have a number of discrete-time dynamical systems (in various doctrines). 

    We discussed it, and we came up with this convention:
      adjective system

    For example:
      deterministic system
    For a deterministic automaton aka Moore machine

      stochastic system
    For a stochastic automaton aka Markov decision process

      dependent system
    For a Poly-dynamical system. 
   
    This also lets us use the word "system" for short.

*** DONE Polynomials: are the coefficients sets or natural numbers?
    CLOSED: [2020-07-15 qua 23:40]
   

**** Jaz:
     Since the coefficients are sets, they should be drawn differently from natural numbers.

     My suggestion is a bold-face


**** Spiv:
     I want to use natural numbers, as usually type-set, for my coefficients.

     So we will be instead denoting natural numbers by a different font-face.

**** Resolution:
     We will use mathsf for ordinals. 

     This has been added to the preamble.

*** Jaz:

    I want to use examples from the steady states paper, particularly the ones on page 17,
    in the section on steady states.

    This means giving them before in the section on dynamical systems, and showing what the
    wired together system looks like.

    CLOSED: [2020-07-20 seg 22:14]
    I want to make a new keyword instead of \LMO that can allow me to have a state name and an output symbol.

    I ended up not doing this, and relegating this example to an exercise. <2020-07-20 seg>

*** Jaz: Eventually periodic orbit functor?
    For each eventually periodic orbit that takes t steps to get to an orbit of period p, there is a representable indexed double functor.

    Is there an indexed double functor that yields all eventually periodic orbits? Naively, I expect it to be a colimit over all the representable indexed double functor for each eventually periodic orbit. 

*** TODO Composition of wiring diagrams as nesting
     This needs to be done more explicitly in the section on wiring diagrams as lenses in free cartesian categories.

**** TODO The "main formula" in 4.2.3
     This main formula is really saying that a polynomial morphism is a dependent lens. But sometimes it also means this particular presentation of that fact. It needs to be teased out which is which:

***** TODO 4.70 "Prove that for polynomials p,q, their product is given by the formula in"
      I.e. use the fact that they are dependent lenses, and prove this fact for the dependent lens category.

**** TODO "morphism of polynomials" (also, "map" versus "morphism", let's pick one)
     When do we mean a natural transformation between polynomial functors and when do we mean a dependent lens?

     We should also make it excessively clear that we are going to blur the difference between the two after we prove the equivalence of poly with dependent lenses.
***** TODO Example 4.56 "To give a morphism of polynomials..."
      One in fact gives a dependent lens between their arenas.

***** TODO Ex 4.66 "Constants are sent to constants":  
      "Any morphism"
      Here its a natural transformation at first (constants must get sent to constants?) but then "let's more generally say...we have a map... i.e. and element of the set [of dependent lenses]" so its a dependent lens. 

**** TODO "poly" --> "arena" 
     almost always. See eg ex.4.58 "draw the associated poly"
     he means draw the associated arena as a set of corollas.


**** TODO Dirichlet product -> Parallel product
     
**** TODO "Bimorphic lenses" 
     This should be moved into the part about dependent lenses, to show that lenses are a special case of dependent lenses.

     Move the chatting about the historical name of lenses to chapter 1, only cite Hedges for history (or, if desired, for further reading).

     "We will use the term lens when we want to remind the reader that morphisms between monomials are much simpler.." probably a bad idea, just use dependent lens in general, and I would recommend using "lens" as a shorthand for dependent lens (e.g. 'a lens between polynomials').

**** TODO Lens pairing
     All pairing of lens like objects should be vertical.
     
***** TODO Bimorphic lenses
      Few issues here.

***** TODO Moore Machines
      Few issues here e.g. (A, B)-machines.

**** TODO "Moore Machines"
     Needs to be renamed to "determinsitic system"
     Definition should be the one from chapter 1.

     Most examples could appear in chapter 1 as well, the examples here should be focused on translating the lessons of chapter 1 into the polynomial framework.

***** TODO "here's a picture of a moore machine with"
      This example is also in chapter 1, and should probably just refer back.

***** TODO "such that the following can be identified with a morphisms"
      Should probably be moved to chapter 1 (also problem 3 will be hard to answer)

      
      
**** TODO "Generalized Moore Machines"
     Should be changed to dependent systems.

     
**** TODO ASK SPIV 4.3.3. Wiring Diagrams
     The way wiring diagrams are discussed here names the boxes directly, i.e. each interface is named, and then they are filled with anonymous systems.

     The way I was doing it in C1 was that the boxes are filled with the systems, and are themselves nameless.

    ASK SPIV: Which way does he prefer? I lean to the one I used, since I don't think the controller is the interface but rather then entire system wired into that interface, and same with the box labeled "system" in 4.3.3 but which does not in fact refer to a system.
